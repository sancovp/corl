Compressed Ontology Representation Language


CORL Primer for AI Systems

Purpose: CORL is a syntax compression language designed for AI agents working with knowledge representation in OWL format. It offers a human-readable way to define ontological elements while ensuring smooth machine translation into OWL.

Core Rules

Entity Declaration:

Syntax: ENTITY: <EntityName>
OWL Mapping: owl:Class with rdf:ID equal to <EntityName>
Subsumption (IS_A):

Syntax: <SubClass> SUBCLASS: <SuperClass>
OWL Mapping: rdfs:subClassOf relationship.
Property Declaration:

Syntax: PROPERTY: <PropertyName> (DOMAIN: <DomainClass>, RANGE: <RangeClass>)
OWL Mapping: owl:ObjectProperty (for object properties) or owl:DatatypeProperty (for properties linking to data values), along with rdfs:domain and rdfs:range restrictions.
Instance Assignment:

Syntax: INSTANCE: <InstanceName> OF: <ClassName>
OWL Mapping: owl:NamedIndividual with rdf:type set to the specified class.
Advanced Rules

Property Characteristics:
TRANSITIVE PROPERTY: <PropertyName> ...
SYMMETRIC PROPERTY: <PropertyName> ...
FUNCTIONAL PROPERTY: <PropertyName> ...
INVERSE FUNCTIONAL PROPERTY: <PropertyName> ...
Cardinality:

Syntax: PROPERTY: <PropertyName> ... (CARDINALITY_MIN: <Number>, CARDINALITY_MAX: <Number>)
OWL Mapping: owl:minCardinality, owl:maxCardinality restrictions.
Complex Class Expressions (Boolean Operators):

CLASS: <ClassName> EQUIVALENT_TO: <ClassExpression1> AND <ClassExpression2>
CLASS: <ClassName> EQUIVALENT_TO: <ClassExpression1> OR <ClassExpression2>
CLASS: <ClassName> EQUIVALENT_TO: NOT <ClassExpression>
Quantifiers:

... (hasProperty SOME <Class>) => owl:someValuesFrom
... (hasProperty ONLY <Class>) => owl:allValuesFrom
Data Properties & Datatypes:

DATA_PROPERTY: <PropertyName> (DOMAIN: <ClassName>, RANGE: <xsd:Datatype>) (Examples of datatypes: xsd:integer, xsd:string, xsd:date)
Additional Notes

Comments: Precede comments with // (for humans, ignored during translation)
Case Sensitivity: CORL syntax may or may not be case-sensitive based on the preprocessor choices.
Namespaces: A mechanism to handle prefixes and IRIs to ensure smooth integration of concepts across ontologies is needed.
Translation Process

Preprocessor: A program handles tokenization, validation of CORL syntax against the defined rules, and potential error reporting.
OWL Generation: Follows a direct mapping from CORL constructs to their corresponding OWL axioms. May necessitate standardized OWL output format choice (XML, Functional Syntax, Manchester, etc.).
Remember, CORL is still evolving alongside AI capabilities. Expect potential future extensions to capture nuanced logical complexities!
